# What does it do?
It's just a small program to convert integers to binary.
A python version is also available as a .py file.

## Two versions: Python vs C++
### C++ version, maintained by LoulouNoLegend
    It's the main version.
    
### Python version, maintained by ZeyaTsu
    It may not be updated more than just the rewrite of the v1, eveything depends on him.
    This version is also not available as a program, you can only find the ".py" file in the python directory.


## Current features
 - Decimals to binary
 - IPV4 to binary
 - IPV6 to binary


## Next features to add (C++)
  - GUI

Maybe more in the future...
