# What does it do?
It's just a small program to convert integers to binary.
A python version is also available as a .py file.

*I made that to easily convert my integer to binary without doing it by head in class. The code is all public and open source.*

## Features
 - Decimals to binary
 - IPV4 to binary
 - IPV6 to binary


## Why a Python version?
The python alternative is made by [ZeyaTsu](https://github.com/ZeyaTsu) and may not be updated to more than the v1 of the main branch (C++).
It is also not yet available as a program (exe), you can only find the ".py" file in the python directory and download it, then launch it. (You will need to install python)
