A python version is also available as a .py file.

## Two versions: Python vs C++
### C++ version, maintained by LoulouNoLegend
    It's the main version.
    
### Python version, maintained by ZeyaTsu
    It may not be updated more than just a rewrite of the v1, eveything depends on him.


## Next features to add (C++):
  - GUI

Maybe more in the future...
